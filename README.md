# Note Taker App

## Description
In this project, I designed my first server with express.js!! I learned how to make GET, POST and DELETE routes in order to dynamically generate, get and delete content. You can use it by adding a note, saving the note and retrieving notes all on the `/notes` pgae

## Installation
To install, clone my repository to your directory, run npm install to install the required dependencies, and start the server using npm start. Then take the given url and run it in the browser of your choice!
